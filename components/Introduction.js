          Over the years, my fascination with structured thinking has led me to a background in data & engineering.
          After my short coding experience in the mechanical engineering field, I've found satisfaction from learning the fundamentals of computer science
          and software construction to exploring the emerging trends in the tech world (machine learning, web development, DevOps, etc.).
          In short, I am a problem solver who talks to computers. When not coding, I lift weights, watch the NBA, and leetcode (highly recommend).
